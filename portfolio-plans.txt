 requirement: I want to create a webpage which is
  interactive using the current setup,\
  like on opening I want user to see the home page,
   and when mouse moves right or left goes to the
  corrosponding setup page and so on the setup
  pages are explored according to the mouse
  movement or button provided above,\
  the pages should be like walls and when user
  moves cursor it should be like the user vision is
   moving and they are seeing the walls around
  according to the user cursor movement or buttons
  clicked, the pages should be only 75% of the
  screen and equally spaced around, and the
  reflection of the pages has to be shown in below
  simulated water in blurry way like in stranger
  things, and whole thing should be in black and
  also suitable for light mode where water become
  black and blurry reflection is visible\
  \
  task: don't write the single line of the code
  just guide me how to do it and what can I
  reference it for, cuz I want to write and under
  each line of code on my own and understand what I
   have written
